# python-helpers
Various Python scripts, helper functions, etc., created during day-to-day scripting. Important notice: I'm not an experienced Python programmer, so don't treat this repo like some kind of best practices showcase. It's meant for exercising Python usage. On the other hand, if you'll notice any issues or potential improvements, I'll happily welcome pull requests. :)
